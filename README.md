## Task#1 The Terrifying value of 68 

<h5 style=rgb(252, 211, 71)>This problem came from a clickbait ad on Telegram messanger. 
The ad says "Hey, take a look at the dates of three big world events below
          WW1 28.07.1914
              28+07+19+14=68; 
          WW2 01.09.1939
              01+09+19+39=68; 
          *** 24.02.2022
              24+02+20+22=68
           According to jewish gematria 68 means..... " </h5>

Let me guess what's an average clicker's reaction is. 
Oh my gosh! 68 is the most terrifying value of given day + month + year <century|decade> in the 20th century. It is not a simple coincidence. Hence *** may be the fucking one in the 21th century. 

It sounds like a confirmation bias, isn't it? 


Transform this into a minor math problem and calculate what is a chance of such a coincidence. Play with numbers! 

### Let's see how many days/dates have the value of 68 in 20th century according to the formula above. It's a surprise that there are 365 days in the 20th century which have the sum of 68. The same number is for 21th cetury.  

It's a good question to ask your student or candidate to evaluate his/her analitycal skills. Solve the problem just to count on paper. 5-10 minutes is okay. The main thing is how he/she digs through it. 

Then ask him/her to code it anyway and check it out.

**************************Attached is a short Python code to solve the problem   
          
### The further questions might be as follows. What about the value of 42 and 132, how many days are? Build a distribution of how many days as a function of the value --> How-many-days = f(value).
