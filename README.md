# A collection of Math Tasks to evaluate potential candidates for working at your project

## Task#1 The Terrifying Sum of 68 

This problem came from a clickbait ad on Telegram messanger. 
It says   "Hey, take a look at the dates of three big world events below
          WW1 28.07.1914
              28+07+19+14=68; 
          WW2 01.09.1939
              01+09+19+39=68; 
          *** 24.02.2022
              24+02+20+22=68"

Oh my gosh! 68 is the most terrifying sum of day + month + year <century|decade> in the 20th cenury. Hence *** is the fucking one WW in the 21th century. 

First, looks like a confirmation bias, isn't it? 


### Let's see how many days/dates are in 20th century according to the formula above. It's a surprise that there are 365 days in the 20th century with the sum of 68. The same number is for 21th cetury.  

It's a good question to ask your candidate to evaluate his/her analitycal skills. Let him/her to solve the problem on paper. 5-10 minutes is okay. The main thing is how your candidate goes through it. 

Then ask him/her to code it anyway and check it out.      
          
The further questions might be as follows. What about the sum of 42 and 132, how many days are? Please build a distribution of sum as a function of year
